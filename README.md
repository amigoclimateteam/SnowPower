[Insert description of assets]

SnowPower is a Software as a Service (SaaS) for monitoring and forecasting hydropower generation for energy companies, focusing on estimating the amount of water expected to flow into the reservoir based on a snow water equivalent assessment with a short- (7-day) and medium-term (1 to 6-month) forecast. The software seamlessly integrates satellite, in-situ data, reanalysis products and seasonal forecasts with three Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for monitoring and forecasting hydropower production based on Machine Learning (ML) models. SnowPower targets the hydropower market, which accounts for 43% of Italian renewable electricity production (Terna, 2019). By complementing existing knowledge, SnowPower improves energy companies' internal forecasting models and enables a cost-effective solution to first monitor and then set appropriate and climate-proof energy prices for the spring and summer season.



This project has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the framework of the I-NERGY Project, funded under grant agreement No 101016508
