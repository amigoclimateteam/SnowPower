## General description
The PDF document describes the Snow and Runoff modules of SnowPower, one of the projects of the I-NERGY 1st Open Call. 

SnowPower is a Software as a Service (SaaS) for the monitoring and forecasting of hydropower generation in the Alps at watershed level.

SnowPower relies on three sequential modules operated by as many ML models: Snow, Runoff, and Energy. 

The Snow module yields a Snow Water Equivalent indicator at watershed level by feeding data about each watershedâ€™s orography and meteorology to a dedicated model. 

The Runoff module, informed by the outputs of the Snow module, is tailored to provide the runoff in each watershed during the snowmelt season, which, for the purposes of SnowPower, we define to last from April to September.
